# GiftCare - Restoring Trust in Charitable Giving

In Indonesia, widespread corruption in social assistance programs has severely eroded public trust. Funds meant to support the vulnerable are often misappropriated by corrupt officials, leaving those in need without aid. As a result, donors are increasingly disillusioned, doubting whether their contributions will ever reach the intended recipients.

GiftCare solves this problem by leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency, accountability, and community involvement in charitable giving. Built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), our platform provides a decentralized solution where every donation is securely tracked, and every recipient is verified.

## The Problems We Solve

1. **Corruption in Aid Distribution**  
   Traditional social assistance programs are vulnerable to corruption, leading to misused funds and a lack of support for those in need.

2. **Lack of Transparency**  
   Donors often lack visibility into how their contributions are used, leading to distrust and uncertainty about the impact of their donations.

3. **Disengaged Communities**  
   Charitable giving often lacks community involvement, with little opportunity for donors to participate in decision-making or directly support causes they care about.

## GiftCare's Solution

GiftCare addresses these issues by creating a transparent and decentralized platform for charitable giving:

1. **Nomination System**  
   Recipients in need post their requests for aid, providing transparency about their situation and needs. The GiftCare community reviews these requests to ensure they are genuine.

2. **Community Voting**  
   Community members actively participate in the decision-making process by casting votes to prioritize aid distribution. This ensures that the most urgent cases receive attention, with full transparency in the voting process.

3. **Blockchain-Powered Transparency**  
   All donations and transactions are tracked on the blockchain, providing an immutable record that ensures every contribution reaches the intended recipient without the risk of misuse.

4. **Leaderboards for Prioritization**  
   Based on community votes, recipients are ranked on a leaderboard that highlights the most urgent cases. Donors can choose to support anyone, regardless of their position on the leaderboard.

## Getting Started with `gift_care`

Welcome to your new `gift_care` project, part of the Internet Computer development community! This README provides an overview of both the mission of GiftCare and technical instructions to help you start working on the project.

### Project Setup

By default, creating a new project adds this README and some template files to your project directory. You can customize these files to speed up the development cycle and include your own code. To get started, explore the project directory structure and review the default configuration file. Any changes you make in your development environment won’t affect the production deployment or identity tokens.

### Documentation

To learn more before you start working with `gift_care`, check out the following resources:

- [Quick Start Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)
- [Motoko Language Quick Reference](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/language-manual)

## Running the Project Locally

To test your project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Local Replica**  
   Run the replica in the background:
   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

2. **Deploy Canisters**  
   Deploy your canisters to the replica and generate the candid interface:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

3. **Access the Application**  
   After the deployment, your application will be available at:  
   `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`

4. **Generate Candid Interface**  
   If you’ve made changes to the backend canister, generate a new candid interface:
   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```

   This is recommended before starting the frontend development server and will automatically run any time you deploy with `dfx deploy`.

5. **Start the Frontend Development Server**  
   To start a development server for the frontend:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:8080`, and API requests will be proxied to the replica at port 4943.

### Frontend Environment Variables

If you’re hosting frontend code without DFX, make sure that your project doesn’t fetch the root key in production by making one of the following adjustments:

- Set `DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if using Webpack.
- Use a preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations.
- Modify `dfx.json` by setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override` to a string.
